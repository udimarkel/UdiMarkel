# Image Grid Instructions

## Adding Your Images

To customize the image grid on your portfolio's hero section:

1. Navigate to the `images/grid/` folder in your project
2. Add 10 images named `img1.jpg` through `img10.jpg`
3. Recommended image size: 400x400px or larger
4. Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp

## Current State

The grid currently displays colorful gradient backgrounds as placeholders. These will be replaced automatically when you add your images to the folder.

## Grid Layout

The images are arranged in an asymmetric grid pattern:
- Some images are larger (spanning 2 cells)
- Some images are smaller (1 cell)
- Hovering over any image scales it up by 15%
- The entire grid container floats gently up and down

## Tips

- Use high-quality, visually interesting images
- Mix photos, graphics, and abstract art for variety
- Ensure images look good at square aspect ratios
- The grid works best with colorful, high-contrast images
